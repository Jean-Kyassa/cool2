2.
Why Logging is Important:
Logging is crucial for several reasons:
•
Debugging: It helps identify and fix issues in production environments.
•
Monitoring: It allows you to track application health and performance.
•
Auditing: It provides a record of important events for security and compliance.
•
Analytics: It can be used to gather insights about user behavior and system usage.

Common logging levels, from least to most severe:
•
TRACE: Fine-grained debug information
•
DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems
•
INFO: General information about application flow
•
WARN: Potentially harmful situations that might lead to errors
•
ERROR: Error events that might still allow the application to continue running
•
FATAL: Severe errors that cause the application to abort
